**Digital City Project**
 
The city of Be'er Sheva has been chosen by the Government of Israel as a Pilot City for the National Digital Israel Initiative in the areas of Smart City and Education. Smart7 Data (Open Data) is being implemented by the Beâ€™er Sheva Municipality and the Center for Digital Innovation (CDI) as part of the Digital City project. The project is funded by the Israel Digital headquarters in the Ministry of Social Equality.
 
**What kind of information is available online?**
 
Today, the database contains datasets of central government ministries and several central authorities. The datasets are on a variety of topics, including Transportation, Education, Sports, Public Space, City Planning, Security, Welfare, Religion and more in order to improve the lives of citizens and to create a stronger connection between them, the businesses in the city, and the municipality.
 
In the current repository, we are distributing the code of the CKAN system which we developed the portal on.
